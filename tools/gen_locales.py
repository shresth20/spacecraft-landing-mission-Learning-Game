"""Regenerate locales/locales.js from locales/locales.json.

    python3 tools/gen_locales.py

locales/locales.json is the single source of truth for every word the
mission shows and every clip it speaks. On a web server i18n.js fetches the JSON
itself, so an edit is live at once. From file:// a browser will not hand a
page a local JSON file, so i18n.js falls back to this generated script, which
holds the same data as window.GAME_LOCALES. Re-run this after editing the
JSON, or a file:// run will show the words as they were.
