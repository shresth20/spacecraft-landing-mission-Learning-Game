/* ============================================================
   Geo Drone — the quadrilaterals lesson (the second lesson screen)

   Extracted from the learning module's js/script.js
   (spacecraft-landing-mission-learning) on 2026-10-13: the code pages
   4 to 28 reach, by a scope-aware pass over the module, with the
   patches listed below. Edit it here from now on.

   Pages 4 to 28 of the learning module -- the module's own list of
   them is MISSION below -- played between the mission's two
   quadrilateral screens (the survey of the parallelogram, the rhombus
   and the trapezium, and their landing): the general quadrilateral
   and its two diagonals, the parallelogram, the rhombus and its four
   practices, the trapezium and its three. Each page hands on to the
   next exactly as in the module; page 28's Next brings the mission
   back.

   The choreography is the module's own code, line for line, and so is
   its voice: the module's clips under their own names
   (assets/VO/learn/), found from the words on screen by the module's
   own table (VO_FILE), cue points and all. The module's chrome -- its
   welcome, its section menu and its tools -- is the mission's now
   (SCENE TOOLS in js/script.js), reaching this screen through
   skip(), run({ page }) and setMuted() at the bottom, the same calls
   js/learn.js answers.

   Everything the module looked up on the document it looks up on
   this screen: `document` below is a stand-in scoped to it, and
   every id in the screen's markup carries the prefix `lq-` so it
   can stand beside the first lesson's board without a clash.

   Words: every line is a KEY into locales/locales.json (T), copied
   from the module's locales-quadrilaterals.json.

   *      forward, its border drawn heavy, and d1's name floats off the
   *      drawing onto "base" and becomes it; its height drops from the
   *      crossing and h1 floats onto "height" the same way. Then the lower
   *      half, with h2
   *   4. the third line, the rhombus as the two together, worked where it
   *      stands to ½ × d1 × d2 -- the two heights, end to end along the short

   *      peels off onto a fourth row and is put into words:

   * trapezium the learner has just named: right-angled (two copies make a
   * rectangle), then scalene and isosceles (two copies make a
   * parallelogram). The choreography is one piece of code; the kind only
   * changes the corners and the words. Each kind has two entry points, so
   * Replay and the jump menu can land on the rectangle as well as on the
   * start.
   *
   *   1. the last drawing goes (or, the first time, the cards) and a
   *      trapezium draws itself in the MIDDLE of the board; the
   *      right-angled one has its two right angles marked: "Let us try to
   *      find the area of this ... trapezium."
   *   2. its sides are named there, on arrows: a along the top, b along the
   *      bottom, h up the left -- with the height itself dotted in when the
   *      left side is slanted
   *   3. the board opens out to the right and the trapezium slides across
   *      into the left half of it, leaving a whole half free beside it
   *   4. a copy pops out of the trapezium -- in the trapezium's own colours,
   *      so one shape is seen to become two -- takes a colour of its own,
   *      slides across into the free half and flips upside down there: two
   *      shapes now, half the stage each
   *   5. the trapezium's names are carried across to the copy one at a time,
   *      each starting on the side it was measured from and landing on the
   *      side of the copy that is the same, the two glowing green together:
   *      a, then b, then h
   *   6. the copy closes on the trapezium's right side -- the two make one
   *      rectangle or parallelogram -- and the two names along the top merge
   *      into one, a + b, and so do the two along the bottom
   *   7. the drawing moves to the left half of the board and Swiftee hops
   *      down to the right half, beside the working: Total area = length ×
   *      breadth (or base × height) = (a + b) × h, lighting what it names
   *   8. the copy fades to a dashed outline -- the trapezium is exactly
   *      half: Area of Trapezium = Half of total area = ½ × (a + b) × h
   *   9. the copy goes, the trapezium comes back to the middle with a, b
   *      and h and its parallel marks, and the rule is boxed: Area of
   *      Trapezium = ½ × (sum of parallel sides) × height. Confetti, Next. */

   * drawing fades, and a figure built for each question draws itself in

   * marks and its three measurements before a word is said, and then
   * glides into the left half of the board while the right half is given
   * to the question.
   *
   *   1. page 25, the values (trapNumbers), page 15's way: Swiftee stays at
   *      the heading, the formula builds itself in the right half with a, b
   *      and h as empty boxes, and the three measurements are dragged into
   *      them in order -- every drop answered in a sentence in the heading
   *      -- then the area is chosen from three, answered the same way, and
   *      the working simplifies itself under the formula
   *   2. page 26 (trapPractice1), page 16's way: the bird hops down into
   *      the right half and asks from its box -- the sum of the parallel
   *      sides, then the height -- three answers to each, one by one, and
   *      every verdict a sentence in the box
   *   3. page 27 (trapPractice2), on the board page 26 left standing: the
   *      area, from the same box, and the working under the answers
   *   4. page 28 (trapPractice3), the check for understanding: one
   *      trapezium, one question, three answers, and the working held back
   *      until the learner has answered
   *
   * All three figures are drawn in page 16's scale -- the 440-wide box of
   * pFigRhombus, lengths at 19, arrowheads at 6, an outline of 5 -- and
   * all three stand the same height, so a line, an arrow or a label is the
